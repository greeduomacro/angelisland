Hear ye! Hear ye!

We have just received word that the Orcs are planning an invasion of Brittan Saturday, July 22nd at 11am PST.

We are told their plot is to abduct Lord British in an effort to extort food and land from our good citizens.

Furthermore, we have reason to believe that the orcs will overrun the town in search of our benevolent ruler, but we do not believe they will be able to get at him within his castle.

Do not let them succeed good people of Britannia; we shall pull together and quash this most evil threat.

Note: The town guards will be off for this event.

Orcs interested in participating should contact:
Tor'Kak, [Shadowclan]

All other Citizens should show up at West Britain Bank at about 11am PST on Saturday and be ready to defend their fair city.

Ezra,
the town crier
