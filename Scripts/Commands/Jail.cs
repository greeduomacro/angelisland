/* Scripts/Commands/Jail.cs
 * CHANGELOG
 *	3/25/09, Adam
 *		Add command version of Jail command to be called by PJUM ReportAsMacroer (JailPlayer)
 *		When auto stabeling, 
 *			ignore pets over stable limit (you're going to jail .. too bad)
 *			ignore pets that have something in their pack (you're going to jail .. too bad)
 *  1/12/08, Adam
 *      Stable pets if the jailed player has any
 *	6/14/06, Adam
 *		If the player is offline when they are jailed, set their map to internal
 *	5/30/06, Pix
 *		Changed LogoutLocation to jail when player is not online.
 *  04/11/06, Kit
 *		Added [JailTroublemaker command addition.
 *  11/06/05 Taran Kain
 *		Changed jail sentence to 12 + 12*prev infractions (jail or macroer)
 *  11/06/05 Taran Kain
 *		Changed jail sentence from 24 hours to 24hr + 24 * prev [jail sentences + 4 * [macroer convictions
 *	10/18/05, erlein
 *		Added logging of jailed players.
 *	09/12/05, Adam
 *		Make access Counselor
 *		Counselors can already 'pull' players to jail, and this is more of a 
 *		problem as they must then let them out, or tell the rest of staff to
 *		do so. Using [jail automates the exit process.
 *	09/01/05 Taran Kain
 *		First version. Jails a player and tags their account.
