/* Scripts/Accounting/IPLimiter.cs
 * CHANGELOG:
 *	4/16/09, Adam
 *		Add an assert() to make sure neither account is null in IPStillHot()
 *	11/26/08, Adam
 *		- don't count staff accounts
 *			note: because this check comes before the acct for ourAddress is known, staff can only exceed these limits if they login 
 * 			Player Accounts AFTER Staff Accounts.
 * 		- tell the other accounts on this IP that they are not authorized to connect another account to this IP
 *	11/25/08, Adam
 *		- Make MaxAddresses a core command console value
 *		- Add hot-swap protection (meaningful only when MaxAddresses == 1)
 *	2/27/06, Pix
 *		Changes for Verify().
