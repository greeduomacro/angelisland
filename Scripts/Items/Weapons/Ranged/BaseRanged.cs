/*
 * /Scripts/Items/Weapons/Ranged/BaseRanged.cs
 * CHANGE LOG:
 *	5/13/06, Pix
 *		If you're shooting with poison, make sure they don't have a spell ready
 *	10/16/05, Pix
 *		Streamlined applied poison code.
 *	9/13/05, erlein
 *		Reverted OnSwing() and OnHit() to original rules.
 *	9/12/05, erlein
 *		Change OnSwing() and OnHit() to utilise new poisoning rules.
 *	7/26/05, Adam
 *		Massive AOS cleanout
 *	12/1/04, Adam
 *		add OnEquip() over ride to handle spell cancel when a bow is equipped
 *		(moved from BaseWeapon)
 *	10/22/2004 - Pixie
 *		Changed the "stand time" before allowing a shot to be 0.5 second (was 1.0 second).
 *   04/30/2004 - Pixie
 *       Added checks for the poisoncloth's poison to be null.  null is a valid value for poison
 *       - it means that it's not poisoned.  But we were using it without making sure it wasn't null.
 *   04/27/2004 - Pulse
 * 		Added a check during the OnSwing event to make sure that the player's backpack
 * 		exists before I try searching for any items in it.  This was causing a crash.
 * 		I also added code to the same event to check for weapon ammo before proceeding
 * 		with the poisoning code.
 * 	04/26/2004 - Pulse
 * 		Added poisoning skill based effect to using poisoned cloth to poison arrows
 * 		basically you have only your Poisoning skill chance to use the same level of
 * 		poison as the rag, otherwise you will use -1 level of poison.  If the rag
 * 		is lesser poisoned, -1 level will mean no poison at all
 *   04/17/2004 - Pulse
 * 		Added check for poison cloth in attackers backpack. If the ranged weapon is not poisoned
 * 		and the poison cloth is present, it checks to see if the cloth has charges
 * 		If the cloth has charges, the bow is poisoned for the length of one round
 * 		and the poison cloth charges are reduced by 1, when it reaches 0 it is destroyed.
 * 		The cloth has a delay property that is checked.  This is an additional delay
 * 		that can be used for balancing if needed.  If the delay > 0 it returns the timespan
 * 		which is the next time a swing event can happen for the ranged weapon.
 * 		Because the ranged weapon is now poisoned, this code will be skipped over and
 * 		the swing/hit process will continue as expected.
 * 		Also added the ability for the defender to be poisoned during the OnHit process
 * 		where there is a 50% chance of poisoning, same as melee weapons.
